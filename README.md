# applied-data-science-capstone

The final task of this capstone project is to create a presentation based on the outcomes of all tasks in previous modules and labs.
Your presentation will develop into a story of all your data science journey in this project, and it should be compelling and easy to understand.

In the next exercise, you can find a provided PowerPoint template to help you get started to create a report in slides format.
However, you are free to add additional slides, charts, and tables.

Note that this presentation will be prepared for your peer-data-scientists whom are eager to understand every technical detail of this project.
As such, this presentation will be much more detailed and technical than regular high-level and abstracted presentation for your executive team.

Once you have completed a detailed report, it should be straightforward for you to abstract it into a high-level
deck for your executive team and/or stakeholders.

There are a total of 40 points possible for the final assessment, and you will be graded by your peers, who are also completing this assignment.

Note: If you do not have a desktop version then follow the instructions from the previous lab to get access to PowerPoint online.

1. Complete the slides with relevant details (You are free to add additional slides, charts, tables).
2. Add any additional unused charts or tables to the appendix that you think are relevant to your analysis.
    * Note: You can add a text box to the master slide and use it as a watermark on all slides to prevent your work from being plagiarized.

3. Convert your final presentation into .pdf format.
As part of your grade for the final assignment, you will be asked to upload your presentation for peer review.
4. You will also need to review the final presentation for at least one other peer and grade them before your final grade will be available.
